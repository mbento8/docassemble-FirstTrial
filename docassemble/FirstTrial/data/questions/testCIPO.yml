question: |
  Has ${ res_first_name } the respondent stalked you?
yesno: res_stalked
subquestion: |
  “Stalking” under AS 11.41.260-270 means that the respondent knowingly made “nonconsensual contact” with you two or more times, **and** that because of these contacts, you were reasonably afraid of death or physical injury, or the death or physical injury of a family member.
  
  “Contact” includes many things (not all of them are listed here). Examples are- calling you, messaging you on social media, following you, going onto your property, leaving objects for you, tracking you with GPS, hacking your phone
  
  “Nonconsensual contact” means -
  
  * Contact that you did not specifically agree to, or is not reasonable under generally accepted social norms
  * Contact that you agreed to at first, but it continued after you told the respondent you no longer wanted it
  * Contact that goes beyond what you agreed to Note- If there is back-and-forth conversation or argument between you and the respondent, it is usually not considered nonconsensual contact, even if the conversation is negative
